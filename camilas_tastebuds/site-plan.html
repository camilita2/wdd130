      <p>Welcome to my opinion on food. This is a safe space to get to know about interesting types of food I have tasted so far in rexburg. I also post these food ratings so you guys, most likely if you are international, can relate to some of the opinions I have. Hopefully this will encourage you to go out more and meet new restaurants. I hope you enjoy this little rant I have made for you all.</p>
      <h2>Feedback</h2>
      <p>I would love for you guys to leave your opinions on food here. I would also appreciate it if you leave some good places you think I should try or some American recipes.

      <h3>Food ratings</h3>
        <h4>Cooked Chicken with rice</h4>
    <p>TThis is one of the few home cooked meals I know how to do. I had to learn how to cooked here on rexburg, and lets just say I do a pretty awful job at it. I dont know how to properly season. The first thing I want to point out is that the texture of chicken here is diferent from what it is in my home country. I feel like chicken here is more chewy, but I do like it. On the other hand, I dont feel like I am truly qualified to rate the rice here because I dont really know how to cook it, but from what I have perceived, it is not that different. So far this is one of the best meals because I feel like its healthy and it became my comfort food. 
        Rating 7/10
        <h4>Instant Ramen</h4>
    <p>I am personally not a fan of this type of instant ramen. I think that this brand is very easy to over cook and then the noodles become all mussy. I also think that the soup base is kind of off comparing it to other soup bases from other brands. Even though the taste is not the best, I will give it credit because it gets you out of sticky situations and it is very cheap. In addition to this, I dont feel like ramen is a very healthy food, I would just use it if I have nothing left.
        My overall rating for ramen is a 6/10. 
        </p>
    <h4>Soup from soup for you</h4>
    <p>The soup in soup for you is the best soup I have had in my life. It is very tasty and I feel very nutritious. The soup usually has a protein and you get prety full with a small portion. They change the menu everyday so you get to try all diferent types of soup. I would say it is a very afordable place to eat, you can get a small soup and a grilled cheese for about 8 dollars. Although it is delicious food, the place is just open from 10-2 weekdays. 
        My overall rating for the soup is 10/10 
        
        My favorite place so far.
