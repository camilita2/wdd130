            <h2>What is this website about?</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my opinion on food. This is a safe space to get to know about interesting types of food I have tasted so far in rexburg. I also post these food ratings so you guys, most likely if you are international, can relate to some of the opinions I have. Hopefully this will encourage you to go out more and meet new restaurants. I hope you enjoy this little rant I have made for you all.</p>

            <h2>Feedback</h2>
            <p>I would love for you guys to leave your opinions on food here. I would also appreciate it if you leave some good places you think I should try or some American recipes. 
            </p>
            <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>Please take into account that this outlook on this website is my personal opinion and how much they differ from my home country's food or other countries' food I have had the luck to try. In no way am I trying to offend anyone with my ratings.</p>
